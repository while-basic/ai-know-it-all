# FUTURE FEATURES

Implement these once the chatbot is stable and functioning as intended.

1. LLM should automatically name the conversation based off the context.

2. Obsidian = Read/Write Surface
= Let Obsidian function like a dynamic GUI:
- On each chatbot session, generate a new daily note (chat-2025-05-14.md)
- Auto-link concepts: if “Dallas” is mentioned in memory, link [[Dallas]]
- Add “retrieved memory” as collapsible sections
- Use tags like #retrieved, #generated, #prompt, #reflection

3. Proactive & Self-Initiating
Once the above scaffolding is live:

Proactive suggestions:
“You mentioned Alaska and budget 3× this week. Want to combine them in a trip plan?”

Contextual prep:
On startup, show:

🌞 Welcome back, Chris.  
— Yesterday you said: “Need to check storage payment.”  
— 2 new insights were added.  
— Memory ‘Dallas trip’ was updated.  

Reflective prompts:
“Based on your journal, your tone has been stressed 3 days in a row. Want to reflect?”-
